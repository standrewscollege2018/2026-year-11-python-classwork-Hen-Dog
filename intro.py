'''this is the practice code'''
# print is a function that outputs whatever is inside the brackets
# numbers can be put in print

print(67)

# to put letters in print you need "" which turns it into a string

print("hello")

# decimals = floating point numbers - float means decimal
# boolean yes / no - true / false

# we use variables to store information
# varibles must all be lower case

name = "margit"

# to use multiple words for variable you go
# first_name = "margit"
# last_name = "omen"
# age = 67

age = 5000 

# can print variables using ()
# to combine variables with a string we use f-string
# in a f-string the variable goes in the curly brakets {}

print(f"my favourite video game character is {name} and he is {age} years old")

# we can use input() to get input from the user
# to make pernimant type user_name = input ("what is your name?")
user_name = input ("what is your name tranished one?")
print (f"{user_name}")

print= input ("how old are you?")

# print hello to the user and ask them how old they are

margit = input("what is your name")

print(f"hello {margit}")

print(f"you are {margit} and you are {age} years old")
